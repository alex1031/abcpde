100 nanometres is the diameter ---> check the volume
salt 

400 nanometres if you use water droplets

Let n = number density with units #/m^3

Let c = concentration or bulk mass density of a dispersed aerosol with units = kg/m^3

Let m = average mass of an aerosol particle with units of kg. It can be calculated by density * particle volume. For wet droplets density = 1025 kg/m^3. For salt crystals, which is probably more relevant, the density is 2163 kg/m^3 but of course salt crystals are smaller than droplets.

 

Then c = m * n * volume

n = 10^plume$Concentration ###number density with units #/m^3
m = 2165 ###average mass of an aerosol particle with units of kg/m^3
         ###this is the value for wet particles, but we can use 2163 kg/m^3 for salt crystals
c = m * n * vol  ###concentration mass density of a dispersed aerosol with units kg/m^3
c = c*10^6###concentration mass density of a dispersed aerosol with units mg/m^3
